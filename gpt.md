GPT Workshop, see Wendy email
## Sep 21, 1pm, CGR 1st floor conference room
# LLM GPT programmatic and hands-on

### Learn how GPT works, and how you can make it work for you.

## * Why APIs?
So you can use your favorite language, as part of your own analytics workflows.
It also helps you have someone else pay for it. We'll return to this at the end #5
## * Get and manage API keys
OpenAI will give you $5 worth of tokens to get started

## * Understand API markup with role-playing
System, user, assistant and function roles
https://platform.openai.com/playground
## * Going from words to numbers
Using the embedding API to map prompts to a numeric coordinate space, where you can approach it with regular computational statistics and machine learning.

## * Bioinformatics resource discovery and orchestration
How to operate GPT from the command line and from RStudio. Install TheOpenAIR package (http://openair-lib.org) and register your OpenAI key with the function openai_api_key. For an example embedded in a web app see https://episphere.github.io/gpt.
## * Money and governance
Who pays and who governs 

## Discussion: 
What LLMs are and what they are not
GPT provides the missing resource discovery and orchestration language. The analytical workflows, such as Bioinformatics, are external to GPT ... until you weave them in. This will be illustrated with applications to genomics. A brief demonstration of GPT functions, the next frontier, concludes the workshop.
Contention point: without APIs there is no data science - or scalable bioinformatics for that matter. There is just bondage to unFAIR interfaces and expensive VMs. If we fail to pass this message all we achieve with the workshop is entertainment.*
